# Nuclear Power Plant Malfunctions

This repository has experiments from nuclear power plant (NPP) malfunctions considering the data created by the personal computer transient analyzer ([PCTRAN](http://www.microsimtech.com/pctran)), a PC-based nuclear power plant simulator.

To ensure the reproducibility of the experiments presented in this paper, all malfunction (failure) situations were simulated up to 10 minutes after their occurrence, considering the use of extreme parameters (1,000% of normal) to simulate critical conditions related to the problems that can occur at the power plant. The NPP malfunctions are:
1) Loss of Coolant Accident (Hot Leg);
2) Loss of Coolant Accident (Cold Leg);
3) Steam Line Break Inside Containment;
4) Steam Line Break Outside Containment;
5) Spark Presence for Hydrogen Burn;
6) Loss of AC Power;
7) Loss of Flow (Locked Rotor);
8) Anticipated Transient without Scram;
9) Turbine Trip;
10) Steam Generator A Tube Rupture;
11) Steam Generator B Tube Rupture;
12) Rod withdrawal/Insertion;
13) Reserved for future;
14) Moderator Dilution;
15) Load Rejection;
16) Containment Failure or Spark for H2 Detonation;
17) Fuel Failure at Power;
18) Fuel Handling Accident in Containment;
19) Fuel Handling Accident in Auxiliary Building;
20) Letdown Line Break in Auxiliary Building.
