# Malfunctions Experiment Dataset

To ensure the reproducibility of the experiments presented here, all malfunction (failure) situations were simulated up to 10 minutes after their occurrence, considering the use of extreme parameters (1,000% of normal) to simulate critical conditions related to the problems that can occur at the power plant. The NPP malfunctions are:
1) Loss of Coolant Accident (Hot Leg)
2) Loss of Coolant Accident (Cold Leg)
3) Steam Line Break Inside Containment
4) Steam Line Break Outside Containment
5) Spark Presence for Hydrogen Burn
6) Loss of AC Power
7) Loss of Flow (Locked Rotor)
8) Anticipated Transient without Scram
9) Turbine Trip
10) Steam Generator A Tube Rupture
11) Steam Generator B Tube Rupture
12) Rod withdrawal/Insertion
13) Reserved for future
14) Moderator Dilution
15) Load Rejection
16) Containment Failure or Spark for H2 Detonation
17) Fuel Failure at Power
18) Fuel Handling Accident in Containment
19) Fuel Handling Accident in Auxiliary Building
20) Letdown Line Break in Auxiliary Building

For a comparative analysis, an experiment considering normal operating conditions (0 - Normal Operation) is carried out.
